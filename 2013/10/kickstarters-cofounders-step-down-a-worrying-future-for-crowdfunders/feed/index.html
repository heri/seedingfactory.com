		<description><![CDATA[Robert and Theory, I absolutely agree with you. The media is always looking for something juicy because this catches our attention and get more &quot;views&quot; and &quot;clicks.&quot; Those questions posed are amateur: Journalism 101 - How to Stir up a News Worthy Article Where Doesn&#039;t Exist. The company should be interviewed or other facts should be presented before such claims are made. On another point, there are incredible legal ramification that must be considered if KS wanted to get into health, firearms etc or equity crowdfunding. Without specific information given from KS I think this is very irresponsible to stir up these rumor just to get your article read and your name out there. And the Blackberry example doesn&#039;t work. Blackberry was providing tangible products that needed constant upgrades and advancement. KS is fully functional the way is and people will continue to use because it has one of the greatest crowfunding followings (which is vital is you want to crowdfund) but it doesn&#039;t need to keep up with Apple and all the rest.]]></description>
