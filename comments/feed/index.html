		<description><![CDATA[I do have a Facebook page and have had it since 2010 (reference above reason number 1 &quot;no crowd&quot;) but I don&#039;t have a lot of Facebook &quot;buddies&quot; who have any connections whatsoever with anyone who either has any MONEY or who gives a rat&#039;s ass about either further training for ME or the Deaf needing ASL interpreters!! I don&#039;t think I should HAVE TO make my campaign &quot;personal&quot; - it IS a cut-and-dried, across-the-board UNMET NEED. Kind of along the lines of the Hurricane Katrina victims!! Anyway, my point was, I&#039;m still getting Goose Eggs in all three of my accounts. So don&#039;t think it&#039;s just because you DON&#039;T  have a Facebook page. Your Facebook page would have to be well-connected to a bunch of millionaires.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve noticed that the SUCCESSFUL college-funding campaigns are from Hearing kids and for &quot;mainstream&quot; colleges - how the hell do I get funded to attend Gallaudet for Sign Language Interpreter certification status - I have THREE campaigns out, gofundme.com, gogetfunding.com and fundbackr.com. It isn&#039;t that complicated an issue. There IS a severe shortage of ASL-interpreter fluent people and a very LIMITED number of very expensive places to GET training. What&#039;s wrong with people - or do I have to specifically target DEAF billionaires for this?? I&#039;m beginning to think I&#039;m going to have to win the damn lottery to pay tuition, here!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the information. i have a campaign on YouCaring and like Chocolatini my campaign is at $0 and it&#039;s been 25days. The way i see it, my campaign won&#039;t raise any funds. I don&#039;t have a video yet. Another setback in my campaign is that i know i will not get the 20% funding from friends and family simply because most do not have access to internet. I also do not have a facebook page... Doomed from the start right?]]></description>
